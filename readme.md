# Exploration Repo

This is a repo to try out new and interesting python library that could be useful to work on. I would specifically focus on the domain of a end-to-end data pipeline including but not limited to databases, ETL, AI, ML, deep learning, Gen AI APIs such as AI Agents and generic LLMs, business intelligence and data analytics. Each title represents a library that I am testing out.
